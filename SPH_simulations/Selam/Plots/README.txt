Fig. 10 — Cumulative mass, normalized by total moonlet mass, as a function of strain exceeding
a threshold ε. (a) At 1.5 v_esc, there is negligible difference in strain between targets with 0 Pa and 1 Pa cohesion.
However, as cohesion increases further, the material experiences significantly less deformation.
(b) While increasing the impact velocity can partially offset this effect, it fails to reproduce the
observed post-impact shape.


Supplementary Fig. 1: Initial and final axis ratios (a/b; a/c) for head-on collisions involving two equal-sized moonlets traveling at 2 v_esc.

Supplementary Fig. 4: Collision outcomes at different encounter distances (3.3–3.8 R_primary and beyond 4 R_primary).
Closer to the primary, collisions tend to result in non-merging outcomes, while at larger distances,
merging and bilobed configurations become more frequent.
