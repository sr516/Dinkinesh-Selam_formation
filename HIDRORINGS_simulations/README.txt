# Simulation used for Supplementary Fig. 5: impact between two satellites (black-lined circles),
where the outer satellite is subject to the torque from the 2:1 Lindblad resonance with an inner ring (grey disk).

The simulation was run with the N-body code REBOUND, with ring torque strength provided
by the hydrodynamic code HydroRings.

Data columns:
x_c1, y_c1, z_c1 – position of inner satellite
x_c2, y_c2, z_c2 – position of outer satellite
vx_c1, vy_c1, vz_c1 – velocity of inner satellite
vx_c2, vy_c2, vz_c2 – velocity of outer satellite
