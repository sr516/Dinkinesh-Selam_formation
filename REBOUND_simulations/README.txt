Fig. 6 â€” Collision velocities of two equal-mass satellites as a function of satellite mass
and the orbital distance of the impact point. The lobes that formed Selam are relatively
massive compared to the primary, which means their orbital velocity is small compared
to their mutual escape velocity. In this regime, the collision velocity depends only
weakly on the orbital distance, and most impacts occur at about v_esc due to the
mutual gravitational attraction of the two lobes, which accelerates them before impact.

The mass of each satellite required for the formation of Dimorphos is
m = 5x1e-3xM_primary.
